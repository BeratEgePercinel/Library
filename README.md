Let's design a library database. The project definitions for the Istanbul metropolitan municipality besiktas library are as follows. The library was designed as 3 floors (it can be increased later.) and each floor has surface area, floor type (parquet, stone, etc...), capacity, nickname. There are employees in the library, employees have name, surname, number and salary. There are books in the library. Books have title, author, number of pages, and date of publication. Books have sections. partitions have names. A book can have many chapters. Employees are responsible for Departments. A department can have only one employee. Sections belong to one floor.

The database solution of the above problem is as follows:
